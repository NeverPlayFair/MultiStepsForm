# Multi-Step React Form

Is designed to simplify the data collection process. Rather than overwhelming users with a single, long form, it breaks the input fields into logical steps. It uses React Hook Form for powerful yet lightweight form handling and validation, combined with Heroicons for modern SVG icons, and Tailwind CSS for effortless styling.
